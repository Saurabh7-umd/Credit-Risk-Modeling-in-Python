# Credit Risk Modelling in Python

## Overview
Credit risk refers to the chance that a borrower will be unable to make their payments on time and default on their debt. It refers to the risk that a lender may not receive their interest due or the principal lent on time.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the probability of default on a given obligation, specifically credit cards. This will allow the generation of strategies that minimize the risk of deterioration of the client's financial health.

## Approach

### Data Preparation and Pre-processing
- Checking missing values
- Removing outliers
- Encoding categorical data
- Feature engineering and selection
- Scaling the features
- Balancing the data

### Model Development and Evaluation
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation

## Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- seaborn
- Python 3.9

## Usage
1. Just run the Jupyter notebook in the terminal and it will open in your browser.
2. If you haven't installed Jupyter, install it first.
3. Install XGBoost by using `pip install xgboost` in the command prompt or Anaconda.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- Cross-validation

### Model Evaluation
The final model accuracy achieved is 82%.

## Steps to Run This Model on Your System
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open command prompt in the downloaded folder and run the Jupyter notebook.

## Conclusion
We built a credit risk model using Python and tried different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier). Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were performed, and the final model accuracy achieved was 82%.
