# Credit Risk Modelling in Python

## Overview
Credit risk refers to the chance that a borrower will be unable to make their payments on time and default on their debt. It refers to the risk that a lender may not receive their interest due or the principal lent on time.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the probability of default on a given obligation, specifically credit cards. This will allow the generation of strategies that minimize the risk of deterioration of the client's financial health.

## Approach

### Data Preparation and Pre-processing
- Checking missing values
- Removing outliers
- Encoding categorical data
- Feature engineering and selection
- Scaling the features
- Balancing the data

### Model Development and Evaluation
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation

## Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- seaborn
- Python 3.9


## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- Cross-validation

### Model Evaluation
The final model accuracy achieved is 82%.

## Conclusion
We built a credit risk model using Python and tried different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier). Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were performed, and the final model accuracy achieved was 82%.
